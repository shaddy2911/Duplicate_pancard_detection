# Duplicate_pancard_detection
This  detects the tampering of pan-card using computer vision
Finding out structural similarity of the images helped  in finding the difference or similarity in the shape of the images. Similarly, finding out the threshold and contours based on those threshold for the images converted into grayscale binary also helped  in shape analysis and recognition.
As, the SSIM is ~31.2% we can say that the image user provided is fake or tampered.
Finally we visualized the differences and similarities between the images using by displaying the images with contours, difference and threshold.
